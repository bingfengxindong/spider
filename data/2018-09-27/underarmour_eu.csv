As you're constantly breathing through the mask, the moisture begins to build up and becomes damp/ wet. At this point, the mask is no longer as breathable and when you breathe in from your mouth, the mask, also will be slightly sucked into the mouth. Obviously this makes its virtually impossible to breathe very well.
